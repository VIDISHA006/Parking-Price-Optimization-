# Dynamic Parking Price Optimization Project
Welcome to my project on dynamic parking price optimization! This repository contains a Google Colab notebook where I explore different strategies to set parking prices. The main goal is to understand how various factors can influence pricing to help a parking lot operate more efficiently and potentially boost revenue.

# What's the Project?
I've developed and compared three distinct ways to calculate parking prices:

Model 1: The Simple Occupancy-Based Price
This is the most straightforward approach. The price goes up when the parking lot gets fuller and comes down when it empties out. It's all about reacting to the immediate availability of spots.

Model 2: The Smarter Demand-Based Price
This model takes things a step further. Besides just how full the lot is, it considers other signs of demand, like how long the queue is, traffic conditions nearby, or if it's a special event day. This helps the price react to actual demand, not just physical space.

Model 3: The Machine Learning Predicted Price
Here, I used a Linear Regression machine learning model. Instead of me setting fixed rules, the model learns from past data. It figures out the best way to combine all the different factors (occupancy, demand signs, time of day, etc.) to predict an optimal price. This can make pricing really adaptive and effective.

You'll also find interactive graphs and a dashboard that let you see how each model's prices change over time and compare them side-by-side.

# Key Features
Data Preparation: Cleaning and getting the parking data ready for analysis.

Three Pricing Models: Each with its own logic, from basic to advanced.

Visual Comparisons: Clear graphs to show how the different models behave.

Interactive Dashboard: A user-friendly interface to explore the pricing trends.

# Technologies Used
Python: The main language for all the coding.

Pandas: For handling and manipulating all the data.

Scikit-learn: My go-to library for building the machine learning model.

Panel & Bokeh: Used to create those nice interactive charts and the dashboard.

# How the Notebook is Organized
The Google Colab notebook is structured into easy-to-follow steps:

Steps 1-3: Getting everything set up and loading the data.

Steps 4-7: Defining and visualizing Model 1 and Model 2.

Step 8: Training and using the Machine Learning Model (Model 3).

Step 9: Comparing all three models on one graph.

Step 10: Creating the interactive dashboard.

Step 11: A final summary of the project.

# What's Next? (Future Ideas)
This project lays a solid groundwork! Here are some ideas for how it could be expanded:

Live Data: Connect to actual live parking data.

Smarter AI: Try out even more advanced machine learning models.

Real-World Impact: Simulate how these pricing changes would affect revenue or how busy the lot gets.

Competitor Awareness: Add data about nearby parking lots to make pricing even more competitive.
